      "question": "Where are Linux/Unix systems commonly found in ICS environments?",
      "options": ["Only in corporate IT networks", "Embedded in PLCs/RTUs, network appliances, and some SCADA servers", "Linux is never used in ICS", "Only for gaming systems"],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Linux is widely used in ICS: embedded in PLCs and RTUs, running on network security appliances, powering some SCADA/HMI applications, and in historians."

      "question": "What is the purpose of the 'sudo' command in Linux?",
      "options": ["To shut down the system", "To execute commands with elevated (root) privileges", "To delete files permanently", "To connect to the internet"],
      "correctIndex": 1,

      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "SELinux implements mandatory access controls that restrict processes to only the resources they need, limiting damage from successful exploits."

      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "The /etc/sudoers file controls sudo access - defining which users/groups can use sudo, what commands they can execute, and on which hosts."

      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Setting 'PermitRootLogin no' prevents direct root login over SSH. Users must login with their own account and use sudo."

      "options": ["Deletes the file", "Sets read/write for owner only, no access for others", "Makes file executable", "Changes file owner"],
      "correctIndex": 1,

      "options": ["They run slowly", "They execute with owner's privileges, allowing potential privilege escalation", "They cannot execute", "They use too much disk"],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "SUID binaries run with the file owner's permissions. If vulnerable, attackers can exploit them for privilege escalation."

      "options": ["True", "False"],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "True. Both implement MAC that restricts what processes can do beyond traditional Unix permissions."

      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "SSH keys are cryptographically strong, practically impossible to brute-force, and not vulnerable to phishing."
