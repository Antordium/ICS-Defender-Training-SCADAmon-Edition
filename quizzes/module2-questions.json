    {"id": "m2_q01", "type": "multiple_choice", "difficulty": 1, "question": "What is the primary purpose of network segmentation in ICS?", "options": ["Increase speed", "Isolate security zones and limit lateral movement", "Reduce costs", "Eliminate firewalls"], "correctIndex": 1, "explanation": "Segmentation divides networks into zones to limit attacker movement and contain breaches."},
    {"id": "m2_q02", "type": "multiple_choice", "difficulty": 2, "question": "What is the IDMZ's purpose?", "options": ["House control devices", "Buffer zone between IT and OT networks", "Store backups", "Connect remote sites"], "correctIndex": 1, "explanation": "The IDMZ sits between Level 3 and 4, preventing direct IT-to-OT connections."},
    {"id": "m2_q03", "type": "multiple_choice", "difficulty": 2, "question": "Which device enforces one-way data transfer?", "options": ["Firewall", "Router", "Data Diode", "Switch"], "correctIndex": 2, "explanation": "Data diodes physically enforce one-way communication, providing hardware-enforced isolation."},
    {"id": "m2_q04", "type": "multiple_choice", "difficulty": 3, "question": "In defense-in-depth, if one control fails:", "options": ["System shuts down", "Multiple layers continue protecting", "Users stop working", "Network restores from backup"], "correctIndex": 1, "explanation": "Defense-in-depth uses multiple layers so others protect if one fails."},
    {"id": "m2_q05", "type": "multiple_choice", "difficulty": 2, "question": "What is a jump server used for?", "options": ["Backing up data", "Controlled access point for admin connections to secure zones", "Monitoring traffic", "Speeding transfers"], "correctIndex": 1, "explanation": "Jump servers provide monitored, controlled gateway for administrative access."},
    {"id": "m2_q06", "type": "true_false", "difficulty": 1, "question": "An air gap provides 100% guaranteed protection.", "options": ["True", "False"], "correctIndex": 1, "explanation": "False. Air gaps can be crossed via USB, supply chain, or insider threats (Stuxnet)."},
    {"id": "m2_q07", "type": "multiple_choice", "difficulty": 2, "question": "In IEC 62443, what connects security zones?", "options": ["Tunnel", "Bridge", "Conduit", "Gateway"], "correctIndex": 2, "explanation": "Conduits are communication channels connecting security zones in IEC 62443."},
    {"id": "m2_q08", "type": "multiple_choice", "difficulty": 3, "question": "Best approach for secure ICS remote access?", "options": ["Direct RDP from internet", "MFA through VPN to jump server", "Shared credentials", "Disable logging"], "correctIndex": 1, "explanation": "Use VPN with MFA to reach a jump server, then controlled access to ICS."},
    {"id": "m2_q09", "type": "multiple_choice", "difficulty": 2, "question": "What is east-west traffic?", "options": ["Geographic traffic", "Traffic within the same network zone", "Inside-to-outside traffic", "User-to-server traffic"], "correctIndex": 1, "explanation": "East-west is lateral traffic within a zone; north-south is between internal and external."},
    {"id": "m2_q10", "type": "multiple_choice", "difficulty": 1, "question": "What is a firewall's main function in ICS?", "options": ["Speed up traffic", "Control/filter traffic based on security rules", "Store logs", "Convert protocols"], "correctIndex": 1, "explanation": "Firewalls enforce rules about allowed communications, including ICS-specific filtering."},
    {"id": "m2_q11", "type": "multiple_choice", "difficulty": 2, "question": "Where should the IDMZ be placed?", "options": ["Between Level 0-1", "Between Level 1-2", "Between Level 3-4 (Level 3.5)", "Above Level 5"], "correctIndex": 2, "explanation": "IDMZ sits at Level 3.5, the critical IT-OT boundary."},
    {"id": "m2_q12", "type": "true_false", "difficulty": 2, "question": "VLANs alone provide sufficient ICS segmentation.", "options": ["True", "False"], "correctIndex": 1, "explanation": "False. VLANs can be bypassed; proper security requires VLANs plus firewalls and ACLs."},
    {"id": "m2_q13", "type": "multiple_choice", "difficulty": 2, "question": "What is 'deny by default' policy?", "options": ["Block all traffic including legitimate", "Allow only explicitly permitted traffic", "Deny specific users", "Disable firewall"], "correctIndex": 1, "explanation": "Deny by default blocks everything unless explicitly allowed - recommended for ICS."},
    {"id": "m2_q14", "type": "multiple_choice", "difficulty": 2, "question": "Risk of dual-homed systems in ICS?", "options": ["High electricity use", "Creates bridge between separated networks", "Can't connect to internet", "Requires special licensing"], "correctIndex": 1, "explanation": "Dual-homed systems can bypass security boundaries between networks."},
    {"id": "m2_q15", "type": "multiple_choice", "difficulty": 1, "question": "What is defense in depth?", "options": ["All defenses at perimeter", "Multiple layers of security throughout environment", "Defending deep parts only", "Hidden controls"], "correctIndex": 1, "explanation": "Defense in depth employs multiple control layers throughout IT/OT environment."}
