    {
      "id": "ir_001",
      "question": "What is the primary advantage of passive network monitoring in ICS environments?",
      "options": [
        "It actively blocks malicious traffic",
        "It analyzes traffic without impacting operations",
        "It replaces the need for firewalls",
        "It encrypts all network communications"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "explanation": "Passive network monitoring analyzes traffic non-intrusively without injecting packets or affecting operations. This is critical in ICS where active scanning might disrupt sensitive industrial protocols or cause process upsets."
    },
    {
      "id": "ir_002",
      "question": "Which MITRE ATT&CK for ICS tactic involves preventing safety systems from responding to dangerous conditions?",
      "options": [
        "Collection",
        "Discovery",
        "Inhibit Response Function",
        "Lateral Movement"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "explanation": "Inhibit Response Function is an ICS-specific tactic where attackers prevent safety or protection systems from responding to dangerous conditions—disabling alarms, blocking operator visibility, or suppressing safety system activation."
    },
    {
      "id": "ir_003",
      "question": "Who should have authority to veto security response actions that would create process hazards?",
      "options": [
        "Security Lead",
        "Operations Lead",
        "External consultants",
        "Legal counsel"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "explanation": "The Operations Lead must have authority to veto security actions that would create process hazards. They understand operational implications that security staff may not anticipate. Safety always takes precedence over security response actions."
    },
    {
      "id": "ir_004",
      "question": "What was the attack vector in the Oldsmar water treatment plant incident?",
      "options": [
        "Phishing email",
        "Physical intrusion",
        "TeamViewer remote access with weak credentials",
        "USB drive malware"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "explanation": "The Oldsmar attacker gained access through TeamViewer remote access software installed on an HMI, exploiting weak or shared credentials. This highlighted the critical importance of securing remote access to OT systems."
    },
    {
      "id": "ir_005",
      "question": "Why is time synchronization of logs important for incident investigation?",
      "options": [
        "It improves log storage efficiency",
        "It enables accurate correlation of events across multiple systems",
        "It is required by all industrial protocols",
        "It encrypts log data automatically"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "explanation": "Time-synchronized logs enable accurate correlation of events across SCADA servers, firewalls, workstations, and other systems. Without consistent timestamps, reconstructing attack timelines and understanding attacker movements becomes extremely difficult."
    },
    {
      "id": "ir_006",
      "question": "What is the first priority in ICS incident response?",
      "options": [
        "Evidence collection",
        "Safety",
        "System restoration",
        "Attacker attribution"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "explanation": "Safety is always the first priority in ICS incident response. No response action should create a safety hazard. If security and safety conflict, safety wins—a compromised PLC controlling a dangerous process cannot simply be shut down without safe process shutdown."
    },
    {
      "id": "ir_007",
      "question": "What type of exercise involves walking through incident scenarios with the response team to identify gaps?",
      "options": [
        "Full-scale exercise",
        "Penetration test",
        "Tabletop exercise",
        "Red team engagement"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "explanation": "Tabletop exercises walk through incident scenarios with the response team discussing their actions and decisions. They identify gaps in procedures, coordination, and understanding without requiring technical execution."
    },
    {
      "id": "ir_008",
      "question": "What evidence source can reveal when process manipulation began during an ICS attack?",
      "options": [
        "Email server logs",
        "Historian data showing process value anomalies",
        "Physical access badge logs",
        "Internet browsing history"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "explanation": "Historian data records process values over time. Analyzing historian trends can reveal when manipulation began by identifying anomalies in process values that correlate with attack timelines, showing what was affected and when."
    },
    {
      "id": "ir_009",
      "question": "During an active intrusion on an engineering workstation, what forensic data should be captured before reimaging?",
      "options": [
        "Only firewall logs",
        "Memory capture, as it may contain malware that doesn't persist to disk",
        "Only the Windows Event Log",
        "Hardware serial numbers"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "Memory captures preserve evidence of running processes, network connections, and malware that may only exist in RAM. Many advanced threats don't persist to disk, making memory forensics critical before systems are reimaged."
    },
    {
      "id": "ir_010",
      "question": "Why can't traditional IT containment strategies (immediately isolating compromised systems) always be applied in ICS?",
      "options": [
        "ICS systems cannot be isolated technically",
        "Abruptly isolating systems controlling physical processes may cause safety incidents or equipment damage",
        "Network isolation is illegal in industrial settings",
        "ICS systems are immune to compromise"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "ICS systems control physical processes. Abruptly isolating a system controlling a chemical reactor, pressure vessel, or power grid could cause uncontrolled process conditions, safety incidents, or equipment damage worse than the cyber attack itself."
    },
    {
      "id": "ir_011",
      "question": "What detection method identified the Oldsmar water treatment attack?",
      "options": [
        "Automated SIEM alerts",
        "Network intrusion detection system",
        "Human observation—operator saw the cursor moving",
        "Antivirus detection"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "The Oldsmar attack was detected entirely by human observation—an operator noticed the cursor moving on screen as the attacker changed settings. No automated system alerted on the unauthorized access or dangerous setpoint change."
    },
    {
      "id": "ir_012",
      "question": "What containment approach allows operations to continue while addressing compromised automation?",
      "options": [
        "Immediate full shutdown",
        "Switch to manual operation mode",
        "Ignore the compromise",
        "Delete all logs"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "Some processes can switch to manual control while compromised automation is investigated. This maintains production with increased operator workload, allowing security response without stopping critical operations."
    },
    {
      "id": "ir_013",
      "question": "Which MITRE ATT&CK for ICS tactic involves learning about the OT environment through scanning and device queries?",
      "options": [
        "Initial Access",
        "Discovery",
        "Impact",
        "Execution"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "The Discovery tactic includes techniques for learning about the OT environment: network scanning, querying devices for information, analyzing engineering files, and mapping the control system architecture."
    },
    {
      "id": "ir_014",
      "question": "What critical step must occur before restoring ICS systems to production after an incident?",
      "options": [
        "Sending press releases",
        "Verifying systems operate correctly and security controls are restored",
        "Upgrading to the newest software version",
        "Changing the company name"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "Before returning to production, verify systems operate correctly (functional testing, loop checks), confirm security controls are restored (monitoring active, logs flowing), and ensure detection capabilities cover the exploited attack vector."
    },
    {
      "id": "ir_015",
      "question": "Why should recovery from ICS incidents use known-good backup images rather than attempting to clean compromised systems?",
      "options": [
        "Cleaning is not technically possible",
        "Attackers may have established persistence that's difficult to fully remove",
        "Backups are always faster to restore",
        "Cleaning is more expensive"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "Sophisticated attackers establish multiple persistence mechanisms that are difficult to fully identify and remove. Rebuilding from known-good backups that predate the compromise ensures systems are clean rather than hoping all malware was found."
    },
    {
      "id": "ir_016",
      "question": "What should be compared against secure backups during recovery to detect unauthorized modifications?",
      "options": [
        "Office documents",
        "PLC programs and control logic",
        "Employee phone numbers",
        "Building floor plans"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "PLC programs and control logic should be compared against secure backups to detect any unauthorized modifications. Changes to control logic, especially safety system logic, could indicate attacker manipulation that would persist after network-level recovery."
    },
    {
      "id": "ir_017",
      "question": "What unique forensic challenge exists for legacy Windows systems (XP, 7) in OT environments?",
      "options": [
        "They have too many logs",
        "Modern forensic tools may not support them",
        "They automatically delete evidence",
        "They cannot be connected to networks"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "Legacy Windows versions like XP and Windows 7 may not support modern forensic tools designed for current operating systems. Investigators need alternative approaches and tools compatible with these older platforms."
    },
    {
      "id": "ir_018",
      "question": "What communication principle is important when the OT network may be compromised?",
      "options": [
        "Use the same network for response coordination",
        "Establish out-of-band communication channels",
        "Post updates to social media",
        "Disable all communications"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "When the OT network is compromised, attackers may be monitoring communications. Out-of-band communication channels (cell phones, separate network, physical meeting) ensure response coordination remains confidential from the attacker."
    },
    {
      "id": "ir_019",
      "question": "Deep packet inspection of Modbus traffic provides what security advantage?",
      "options": [
        "Faster network speeds",
        "Encryption of all traffic",
        "Detection of suspicious commands like writes to safety-critical outputs",
        "Automatic malware removal"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "Deep packet inspection that understands industrial protocols can detect suspicious operational commands—a write command to safety-critical outputs, unusual function codes, or configuration changes that generic IT tools seeing only TCP traffic would miss."
    },
    {
      "id": "ir_020",
      "question": "What is process anomaly detection in ICS security monitoring?",
      "options": [
        "Monitoring employee processes",
        "Detecting deviations from expected physical process behavior",
        "Analyzing business processes",
        "Reviewing hiring procedures"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "Process anomaly detection watches for deviations from expected physical behavior—unexpected tank levels, unusual motor speeds, abnormal temperatures. Attackers who manipulate processes must ultimately affect physical parameters that can be detected."
    },
    {
      "id": "ir_021",
      "question": "Why is involving operations staff in all response decisions affecting production systems critical?",
      "options": [
        "To satisfy union requirements",
        "They understand process implications security staff may not anticipate",
        "To slow down the response",
        "Operations staff have no role in incident response"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "explanation": "Operations staff understand process dependencies, safety implications, and operational impacts that security staff may not anticipate. A security action that seems straightforward might cause cascading process failures without operations input."
    },
    {
      "id": "ir_022",
      "question": "How should ATT&CK for ICS be used to improve detection capabilities?",
      "options": [
        "Memorize all technique names",
        "Map current detection capabilities to techniques and prioritize developing detections for coverage gaps",
        "Only focus on IT techniques",
        "ATT&CK is only for attackers"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "explanation": "Map existing detection capabilities to ATT&CK techniques to identify coverage gaps. Prioritize developing detections for high-impact ICS-specific techniques like 'Inhibit Response Function' and 'Impact' tactics that directly threaten physical processes."
    },
    {
      "id": "ir_023",
      "question": "After the Oldsmar incident, what defense-in-depth principle was highlighted regarding dangerous parameter changes?",
      "options": [
        "Remote access should never be used",
        "Multiple control layers (treatment process, monitoring, testing) would detect dangerous levels even if prevention fails",
        "Only use manual controls",
        "Water treatment cannot be secured"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "explanation": "Defense in depth means multiple protective layers. Even if an attacker changes chemical setpoints, subsequent layers—process interlocks, monitoring systems, laboratory testing—should detect dangerous levels before affecting consumers."
    },
    {
      "id": "ir_024",
      "question": "What forensic challenge exists when investigating PLCs and RTUs?",
      "options": [
        "They have extensive logging",
        "Proprietary formats require vendor-specific tools and expertise to analyze",
        "They automatically report all events",
        "They use standard IT forensic formats"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "explanation": "PLC programs, HMI configurations, and historian databases use vendor-specific proprietary formats. Forensic analysis may require vendor tools, specialized expertise, or reverse engineering to understand and analyze these systems."
    },
    {
      "id": "ir_025",
      "question": "When should legal counsel be involved in ICS incident response?",
      "options": [
        "Only after the incident is resolved",
        "Early in the response if legal action is possible, to ensure evidence is handled appropriately",
        "Legal counsel has no role in incident response",
        "Only for NERC CIP violations"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "explanation": "If legal action is possible (prosecution, civil litigation, insurance claims), involve legal counsel early. They ensure evidence collection and handling meet legal standards for admissibility and advise on notification requirements."
    },
    {
      "id": "ir_026",
      "question": "What network-based containment approach can often be taken without disrupting legitimate ICS operations?",
      "options": [
        "Disconnecting all network cables",
        "Carefully crafted firewall rules blocking attacker IPs while allowing legitimate traffic",
        "Shutting down all switches",
        "Removing all firewalls"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "explanation": "Carefully crafted firewall rules can block attacker IP addresses, close compromised ports, or increase segmentation without disrupting legitimate operational traffic—if rules are designed with understanding of required ICS communications."
    },
    {
      "id": "ir_027",
      "question": "What does 'absence of evidence is not evidence of absence' mean in ICS forensics?",
      "options": [
        "All evidence must be preserved",
        "Attackers may have affected devices with no logging capability, so lack of evidence doesn't prove absence of compromise",
        "Evidence always exists",
        "Forensics is not useful for ICS"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "explanation": "Many ICS devices have minimal or no logging capabilities. An attacker who compromised a device without forensic visibility leaves no evidence trail—but the device may still be compromised. Don't assume systems are clean just because no evidence exists."
    },
    {
      "id": "ir_028",
      "question": "Why should credentials be reset even for systems not directly compromised during an incident?",
      "options": [

      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "explanation": "Attackers often harvest credentials from compromised systems that work elsewhere. Even if a system wasn't directly compromised, credentials used on compromised systems should be considered compromised—reset passwords, rotate certificates/keys, and change API keys."
    },
    {
      "id": "ir_029",
      "question": "What is the purpose of functional exercises in incident response planning?",
      "options": [
        "To replace tabletop exercises",
        "To actually execute parts of the plan: test communications, validate contacts, practice procedures on test systems",
        "To train new employees only",
        "To satisfy audit requirements"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "explanation": "Functional exercises go beyond discussion to actually execute parts of the response plan: test communication channels work, validate contact information is current, and practice containment procedures on test systems to verify they work as documented."
    },
    {
      "id": "ir_030",
      "question": "How does EDR deployment in OT environments differ from IT environments?",
      "options": [
        "EDR cannot run in OT",
        "EDR in OT must be configured less aggressively to avoid disrupting legitimate operations",
        "OT requires more aggressive blocking",
        "There is no difference"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "explanation": "EDR in OT environments must be configured appropriately—aggressive blocking or quarantine actions that work in IT might disrupt legitimate industrial processes. Configuration should prioritize visibility and alerting over automatic blocking."

      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "explanation": "Document all recovery actions: what systems were rebuilt, from what backup source, who performed the work, and when. This proves proper restoration, supports post-incident analysis, and may be required for regulatory compliance."

      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "explanation": "Safety instrumented systems are the last line of defense against dangerous process conditions. A compromised SIS might fail to activate when needed, allowing dangerous conditions to escalate to equipment damage, environmental release, or injury/death."

      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "expert",
      "explanation": "Balance evidence collection with operational needs: capture what's possible without disruption (network captures, logs, memory from non-critical systems), document forensic limitations, use live forensic techniques where possible, and preserve evidence for later analysis when systems can be taken offline."

      "options": [
        "Each site responds independently",
        "Establish centralized coordination with consistent communication, share IOCs across sites, prioritize based on criticality, and maintain overall situational awareness",

      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "expert",
      "explanation": "Multi-site incidents require centralized coordination: consistent communication channels, sharing indicators of compromise (IOCs) so all sites can detect the attacker, prioritizing response based on criticality, and maintaining situational awareness across the enterprise."

This continuous improvement cycle strengthens overall security posture."
