    {
      "id": "synth_001",
      "question": "What is the fundamental principle behind defense in depth?",
      "options": [
        "Use a single very strong control",
        "Layer multiple independent defensive measures so failure of one doesn't lead to complete compromise",
        "Focus all resources on perimeter defense",
        "Rely primarily on user training"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "explanation": "Defense in depth layers multiple independent defensive measures. No single control prevents all attacks, so if one layer fails, others continue to provide protection. This approach is fundamental to ICS security architecture."
    },
    {
      "id": "synth_002",
      "question": "Which layer of defense in depth protects against physical access to control system components?",
      "options": [
        "Application Security",
        "Network Security",
        "Physical Security",
        "Data Security"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "explanation": "Physical Security is the outermost layer—fences, access control, cameras, and locked enclosures protect against physical access to control system components. Many sophisticated cyber attacks benefit from or require physical access."
    },
    {
      "id": "synth_003",
      "question": "Why should defensive layers be independent of each other?",
      "options": [
        "To reduce costs",
        "So that failure of one layer doesn't compromise the others",
        "To simplify management",
        "Independence is not important"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "explanation": "Layer independence means failure of one layer doesn't compromise others. If an attacker bypasses the firewall, host controls should still resist. If credentials are stolen, network segmentation limits lateral movement. Shared dependencies reduce defense effectiveness."
    },
    {
      "id": "synth_004",
      "question": "What role does the IDMZ play in defense in depth architecture?",
      "options": [
        "Optional extra network segment",
        "Control point where all IT-to-OT traffic must traverse through monitored services",
        "Storage location for backups",
        "Testing environment for new software"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "explanation": "The IDMZ serves as a critical control point where all IT-to-OT traffic must traverse. Services requiring both IT and OT access reside there, creating a monitored choke point. Attackers must pass through this heavily monitored zone to reach OT systems."
    },
    {
      "id": "synth_005",
      "question": "In the Ukraine 2015 power grid attack, what enabled attackers to move from IT to OT networks?",
      "options": [
        "Physical intrusion",
        "Weak network segmentation and obtained SCADA remote access credentials",
        "Zero-day vulnerabilities in PLCs",
        "Insider threat"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "explanation": "Attackers moved from IT to OT with apparent ease due to weak network segmentation, and they obtained credentials for SCADA remote access. Stronger segmentation and credential protection could have prevented or slowed this movement."
    },
    {
      "id": "synth_006",
      "question": "What is risk-based prioritization in ICS security?",
      "options": [
        "Protecting all assets equally",
        "Using consequence-based risk assessment to prioritize security investments on highest-impact controls",
        "Ignoring low-probability threats",
        "Focusing only on compliance requirements"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "explanation": "Risk-based prioritization uses consequence-based risk assessment to direct limited resources to highest-impact controls first. Crown jewel analysis identifies what must be protected most, ensuring critical risks are addressed before less important ones."
    },
    {
      "id": "synth_007",
      "question": "How should security architecture address the lack of inherent security in legacy industrial protocols?",
      "options": [
        "Ignore protocol security entirely",
        "Compensate through protocol isolation, protocol-aware monitoring, and secure gateways",
        "Replace all PLCs immediately",
        "Disable all industrial protocols"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "explanation": "Since legacy protocols like Modbus lack inherent security, architecture must compensate: isolate legacy protocols on dedicated segments, deploy protocol-aware monitoring for anomaly detection, and use secure gateways for protocol breaks at zone boundaries."
    },
    {
      "id": "synth_008",
      "question": "What enables effective incident response from an architecture perspective?",
      "options": [
        "Minimal network documentation",
        "Network segmentation that provides containment options and pre-planned isolation procedures",
        "Flat network architecture",
        "Shared administrator accounts"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "explanation": "Network segmentation provides containment options during incidents. Pre-planned isolation procedures can execute quickly because the architecture supports them. Without segmentation, containing an incident without shutting down everything becomes extremely difficult."
    },
    {
      "id": "synth_009",
      "question": "An organization has strong perimeter firewalls but weak host security on engineering workstations. What defense in depth principle is violated?",
      "options": [
        "Least privilege",
        "Independent failure—all security depends on a single control layer",
        "Need to know",
        "Defense in depth is maintained"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "This violates independent failure. If an attacker bypasses perimeter firewalls (via phishing, VPN compromise, or supply chain), weak host security means nothing stops them. Each layer should provide independent protection."
    },
    {
      "id": "synth_010",
      "question": "How does application whitelisting on engineering workstations contribute to defense in depth?",
      "options": [
        "It improves network speed",
        "It prevents attacker tools from executing even if the workstation is compromised",
        "It replaces the need for network segmentation",
        "It provides encryption"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "Application whitelisting prevents unauthorized executables from running. Even if an attacker reaches an engineering workstation through network compromise, they cannot execute their tools—providing a host-based defense layer independent of network controls."
    },
    {
      "id": "synth_011",
      "question": "What security trade-off exists when implementing strict network segmentation?",
      "options": [
        "No trade-offs exist",
        "Added security creates potential single points of failure (firewalls) that could impact availability",
        "Segmentation reduces security",
        "Segmentation eliminates the need for monitoring"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "Network segmentation requiring traffic through firewalls adds security but creates single points of failure. A firewall failure could halt production. Resolution includes redundant firewalls in high-availability configuration, accepting additional complexity for both security and availability."
    },
    {
      "id": "synth_012",
      "question": "How did Ukrainian operators restore power quickly after the 2015 attack?",
      "options": [
        "Automatic failover systems",
        "Manual operation capability—they could operate equipment without relying on compromised automation",
        "Quick system reimaging",
        "Backup SCADA systems"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "Ukrainian operators restored power within hours through manual operations. They retained the capability to operate equipment without relying on compromised automation—a response capability many modern utilities have lost through increased automation."
    },
    {
      "id": "synth_013",
      "question": "What does 'level-appropriate security' mean in Purdue Model implementation?",
      "options": [
        "All levels have identical security",
        "Higher levels (closer to physical process) require stricter controls, potentially including hardware-enforced protection",
        "Lower levels need more security",
        "Level doesn't affect security requirements"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "Level-appropriate security means higher Purdue levels (Level 0-1 near physical process) require stricter controls. These levels may need hardware-enforced protection like data diodes, while higher levels can use software firewalls with appropriate policies."
    },
    {
      "id": "synth_014",
      "question": "How should secure backup storage be positioned in ICS architecture?",
      "options": [
        "On the same servers as production systems",
        "Isolated from production systems with controlled access",
        "Accessible to all network users",
        "Backups are not part of security architecture"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "Secure backup storage should be isolated from production systems. If backups are accessible from compromised systems, attackers can encrypt or delete them (ransomware). Isolated backup storage with controlled access enables recovery even after significant compromise."
    },
    {
      "id": "synth_015",
      "question": "What is the relationship between governance policies and technical controls?",
      "options": [
        "They are unrelated",
        "Policies enable and sustain technical controls; without governance, technical controls degrade over time",
        "Technical controls replace the need for policies",
        "Policies are only for compliance audits"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "Technical controls require policy backing. Firewall rules need change management policies. Access controls need identity management policies. Without governance, technical controls degrade—rules accumulate, access creeps, and configurations drift from secure baselines."
    },
    {
      "id": "synth_016",
      "question": "How does detection support the broader defense in depth strategy?",
      "options": [
        "Detection replaces prevention",
        "Detection identifies when preventive controls fail, enabling response before significant damage occurs",
        "Detection is only useful for compliance",
        "Prevention eliminates the need for detection"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "Detection identifies when preventive controls fail. No prevention is perfect, so detection provides the trigger for response actions that contain damage before it becomes catastrophic. Detection and prevention work together, not as alternatives."
    },
    {
      "id": "synth_017",
      "question": "What compensating controls address vendor remote access security trade-offs?",
      "options": [
        "No controls needed if vendor is trusted",
        "Time-limited access, MFA, session recording, dedicated jump server, and monitoring",
        "Permanent unrestricted access",
        "Only password authentication"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "Vendor remote access creates security risk but may be operationally necessary. Compensating controls include: time-limited access, MFA, session recording for accountability, dedicated jump servers, and enhanced monitoring of vendor connections."
    },
    {
      "id": "synth_018",
      "question": "How did the Industroyer/CrashOverride malware (2016 Ukraine attack) differ from the 2015 attack approach?",
      "options": [
        "It used the same methods",
        "It directly interacted with industrial protocols (IEC 104, IEC 61850, OPC DA) without requiring human-operated remote access",
        "It only affected IT systems",
        "It was less sophisticated"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "Industroyer/CrashOverride could directly speak industrial protocols (IEC 104, IEC 61850, OPC DA) to manipulate power equipment. Unlike 2015 where attackers used legitimate remote access tools manually, this malware automated the attack on the industrial process itself."
    },
    {
      "id": "synth_019",
      "question": "What security architecture principle addresses the supply chain compromise scenario?",
      "options": [
        "Perimeter defense only",
        "Defense in depth with vendor update staging, integrity verification, and behavioral monitoring post-update",
        "Trust all vendor software",
        "Avoid all software updates"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "Supply chain attacks bypass traditional perimeter defenses. Defense in depth addresses this through: staging and testing vendor updates before production, integrity verification where possible, network monitoring for unusual outbound connections, and behavioral monitoring detecting post-update anomalies."
    },
    {
      "id": "synth_020",
      "question": "What does 'security lifecycle' mean for ICS security programs?",
      "options": [
        "Security is a one-time project",
        "Continuous cycle: identify risks, protect, detect, respond, recover, then improve based on lessons learned",
        "Only focus on compliance deadlines",
        "Security ends after implementation"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "Security is a continuous lifecycle: identify risks, protect against them, detect when protection fails, respond to contain damage, recover operations, then improve based on lessons learned. The threat landscape evolves, so defenses must evolve with it."
    },
    {
      "id": "synth_021",
      "question": "If each defensive layer independently stops 80% of attacks reaching it, what is the theoretical overall protection of four independent layers?",
      "options": [
        "80%",
        "99.84% (1 - 0.2^4)",
        "320%",
        "64%"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "explanation": "If each layer stops 80% of attacks (allowing 20% through), four independent layers allow only 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.2 = 0.0016 (0.16%) through, providing 99.84% protection. This assumes layer independence—shared dependencies reduce effectiveness dramatically."
    },
    {
      "id": "synth_022",
      "question": "What architectural decision addresses the challenge of engineering workstations being primary attack targets?",
      "options": [
        "Place them on the general IT network",
        "Dedicated segment with strict controls: no direct internet, application whitelisting, USB restrictions, intensive monitoring",
        "Allow unrestricted access for productivity",
        "Engineering workstations don't need special treatment"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "explanation": "Engineering workstations are primary targets because they have legitimate access to control systems. Placing them in a dedicated segment with strict controls (no internet, whitelisting, USB restrictions, monitoring) provides layered protection for these critical systems."
    },
    {
      "id": "synth_023",
      "question": "How does tiered authentication address the security vs. usability trade-off for HMI operations?",
      "options": [
        "Eliminate all authentication",
        "View-only access with basic authentication, but critical changes require stronger authentication",
        "Require maximum authentication for all actions",
        "Use shared passwords for speed"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "explanation": "Tiered authentication balances security and usability: basic authentication for view-only access supports operational awareness, but changes to critical setpoints require stronger authentication. This maintains security without impeding safety-critical response times."
    },
    {
      "id": "synth_024",
      "question": "What does evaluating architecture for 'shared dependencies' reveal about defense effectiveness?",
      "options": [
        "Dependencies improve security",
        "If the same credential works across all layers, layer independence is lost and overall effectiveness drops dramatically",
        "Shared dependencies have no impact",
        "Dependencies simplify management"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "explanation": "Shared dependencies undermine defense in depth. If the same credential works across all layers, stealing it bypasses all layers at once—making theoretical 99.84% protection meaningless. Evaluate architectures for shared credentials, shared accounts, and cascading trust relationships."

      "question": "How should AD/authentication architecture support OT requirements according to Purdue Model alignment?",
      "options": [
        "Single domain for all systems",
        "Consider separate forests, tiered administration, and service account management aligned with Purdue levels",
        "No authentication in OT",
        "Share all administrative accounts"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "explanation": "AD architecture should consider: separate forests to prevent IT compromise from affecting OT, tiered administration with separate privileged accounts for each Purdue level, and service account management that limits credential scope to appropriate zones."
    },
    {
      "id": "synth_026",
      "question": "What is the architectural purpose of protocol breaks or secure gateways at zone boundaries?",
      "options": [
        "Improve network speed",

      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "explanation": "Protocol breaks/gateways terminate insecure protocols at zone boundaries and re-initiate them on the other side (or translate to more secure protocols). This prevents vulnerabilities in legacy protocols from being directly exploitable across zones while maintaining necessary data flow."

    {
      "id": "synth_027",
      "question": "How does continuous asset discovery support defense in depth?",
      "options": [
        "Asset discovery is separate from security",
        "You cannot defend what you don't know exists—unknown assets represent unprotected gaps in defenses",
        "Static inventories are sufficient",
        "Discovery creates security risks"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "explanation": "Unknown assets are unprotected assets. They may lack hardening, monitoring, and inclusion in backup procedures. Continuous discovery identifies new devices appearing on the network, enabling application of appropriate security controls and preventing defense gaps."

        "Ignore until replacement",
        "Remove from network entirely"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "explanation": "When immediate patching isn't possible, implement compensating controls: enhanced network isolation, increased monitoring, restricted access, and additional authentication. Include replacement in long-term capital planning while managing current risk through layered compensating controls."

      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "explanation": "While layers should fail independently, they should detect and respond together. SIEM correlates alerts: network monitoring alerts when host controls are bypassed, credential theft detected by AD triggers network access review. This integration enables coordinated defense response."
