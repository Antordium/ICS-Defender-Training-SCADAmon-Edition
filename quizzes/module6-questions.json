        "IT risk assessment is the only valid approach",
        "ICS systems don't require risk assessment"
      ],
      "correct": 1,

      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "medium",

      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "Crown Jewel Analysis identifies the most critical assets whose compromise would cause unacceptable consequences. For a water utility, this might be chemical dosing systems. Protecting these crown jewels gets highest priority."

      "question": "Why must OT security policies consider 24/7 operations and emergency access needs?",
      "options": [
        "To simplify audit documentation",
        "Because operations staff may need access during off-hours and emergencies without delays that impact safety",

      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "ICS environments operate continuously, and emergencies don't wait for business hours. Access control policies must balance security with the need for authorized personnel to respond quickly to operational emergencies that could impact safety."

      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "Undocumented systems discovered during audits indicate weak asset management. Complete asset inventories are fundamental to ICS security—you cannot protect what you don't know exists. Continuous asset discovery is essential."

      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "Colonial Pipeline shut down OT operations because they couldn't verify IT systems hadn't spread to OT, and they lacked billing capabilities. This highlights the need to understand, document, and plan for IT/OT interdependencies."

      "id": "gov_021",
      "question": "What is the difference between IEC 62443 SL-T, SL-A, and SL-C?",
      "options": [

        "Air-gapped systems cannot have vulnerabilities"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "explanation": "ICS risk assessment must consider context: the same vulnerability in an air-gapped HMI has different actual risk than in an internet-facing server. Compensating controls (network isolation) reduce exploitability, though the vulnerability should still be tracked."
    },
    {
      "id": "gov_023",
      "question": "NERC CIP requirements scale based on what criteria?",
      "options": [

      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "explanation": "NERC CIP requirements scale based on the impact rating of facilities on the bulk electric system. High, Medium, and Low impact ratings determine which CIP requirements apply and their stringency. Impact assessment per CIP-002 drives this categorization."

        "Using raw log data for transparency"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "explanation": "Executive sponsorship requires presenting risks in business terms: operational risk to production, potential financial impacts, regulatory exposure, and reputational consequences. Technical metrics should be translated into business relevance."

      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "explanation": "Major incidents affecting critical infrastructure typically prompt regulatory responses. Following Colonial Pipeline, TSA imposed new cybersecurity requirements on pipeline operators. Organizations should anticipate increased regulation after major sector incidents."

      "id": "gov_028",
      "question": "How should OT patch management policy differ from IT patch management policy?",
      "options": [
        "OT should patch faster than IT to ensure security",

      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "explanation": "OT patch management must account for: vendor certification requirements (patches may void support), limited maintenance windows for critical systems, extensive testing needs, and high availability requirements. Patch timelines are typically months rather than days."

      ],
      "correct": 1,

      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "explanation": "NIST SP 800-82 recommends ICS risk management integrate with enterprise risk management while maintaining ICS-specific considerations. This ensures executive visibility while preserving the technical depth needed for OT risk decisions."

      "question": "How should an organization handle a situation where NERC CIP requirements conflict with vendor-recommended security configurations?",
      "options": [
        "Always follow vendor recommendations over regulations",
        "Document the conflict, implement CIP requirements, work with vendor on compliant configurations, and involve legal if needed",
        "Ignore the regulation to maintain vendor support",
        "Disable the affected systems entirely"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "expert",
      "explanation": "Regulatory requirements take precedence, but conflicts must be managed carefully: document the specific conflict, implement CIP requirements, work with vendor to develop compliant configurations, and involve legal/compliance if the vendor cannot support compliance."

      "question": "What key elements should an ICS incident response policy include that differs from IT incident response?",
      "options": [
        "IT and ICS incident response are identical",
        "Coordination with operations staff, process safety considerations, safe system restart procedures, and maintaining operational safety during response",
        "Focus only on data recovery",
        "Immediate system shutdown regardless of process state"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "expert",
      "explanation": "ICS incident response must coordinate with operations staff who understand process impacts, consider process safety throughout response (avoid actions that could cause physical harm), define safe restart procedures, and balance security response with maintaining safe operations."

      "question": "How should an organization measure the maturity of its ICS security program over multiple years?",
      "options": [
        "Count the number of security tools purchased",
        "Track progression through NIST CSF tiers, closure of IEC 62443 gaps between SL-T and SL-A, audit findings trending, and incident metrics",
        "Security program maturity cannot be measured",
        "Survey employee satisfaction with security"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "expert",
      "explanation": "Measure maturity through: NIST CSF tier progression (Partial to Adaptive), IEC 62443 gap closure (SL-A approaching SL-T), year-over-year audit finding trends, mean time to detect/respond to incidents, and completion of security program milestones."

      "question": "A new regulation requires asset owners to report ICS security incidents within 24 hours. What governance preparations are needed before this regulation takes effect?",
      "options": [
        "Wait until an incident occurs to develop procedures",
        "Define incident classification criteria, establish reporting thresholds, create report templates, identify authorities, test reporting procedures, train staff",

      "correct": 1,
      "difficulty": "expert",
